        <p>Another simple dish, this is a Carrot and Beef stew, very comforting and simple, perfect for those winter days where you're craving a home-cooked meal. This stew goes perfect with a side of mashed potatoes, though you can also have it with rice.</p>
        <p>This is a meal I had all the time growing up, so this recipe is based on how my mother cooks it.</p>
        <p>So let's get down to business, for ingredients you will need:</p>
        <ul class="myul">

            <li>Beef Chunks - 500g</li>
            <li>Concentrated Tomato Paste - half a tube</li>
            <li>Parsley - 30g</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>White Pepper</li>
            <li>Smoked Paprika Powder</li>
            <li>Bay Leaf - 2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that we have our ingredients, we can begin making our delicious Carne Estufada!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, start by slicing your garlic cloves into slices, remember to crush before you start slicing so you get as much flavour as you can out of it. Then, dice your onion.</li>
            <li>Grab a large pot, heat up some olive oil in medium-high heat. Once hot, throw in your garlic, onion and bay leaf, and cook until soft and translucent. Then, add in your beef and carrots, and stir through for a minute until the meat has lightened in colour.</li>
            <li>Now add in enough water to cover everything, and add the concentrated tomato paste. Add your seasonings to taste, and let stew cook for about 2 hours. After the two hours are up, chop the parsley leaves and throw throw into the pot, let cook for about 2 minutes. Serve with mashed potatoes or rice, and you're all set!</li>
