        <p>So this one isn't actually a Portuguese recipe, it's Brazillian, however this is a staple in my cooking as a Portuguese person. This is supposed to be a side, you'd have it with a portion of meat, chips and rice, however I like to eat it as well as the main part of the dish, along with just rice or both rice and chips, as it stands out on its own. The main gist of this dish is black beans and pork, it is delicious and filling.</p>
        <p>This recipe doesn't require a lot of work, mainly just patience as the longer it cooks the richer it tastes and the better the consistency. I also recommend making rice the Portuguese way for the side, however it works however you prefer to cook your rice!</p>
        <p>So let's get down to business, for ingredients you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Garlic Cloves - 3</li>
            <li>Onion - half</li>
            <li>Chouriço - half</li>
            <li>Pork Belly - 100g</li>
            <li>Black beans - 460g</li>
            <li>Olive oil or Butter</li>
            <li>Bay Leaves - 3</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>White Pepper</li>
            <li>Smoked Paprika Powder</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that we have our ingredients, we can begin making our delicious Feijoada!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, start by slicing your garlic cloves into slices, remember to crush before you start slicing so you get as much flavour as you can out of it. Then, dice your onion. Next, grab your chouriço, cut it in half, then cut into smaller slices. Afterwards, grab your pork belly, and cut into smaller slices.</li>
            <li>Now, you want to grab a large frying pan with high sides, or a wok, and heat up some Olive Oil (or Butter). Once the oil is hot, throw in your diced up garlic and onion, as well as your bay leaves. Ideally keep the heat at a medium-high temperature, to soften the onion without burning.</li>
            <li>Once the onion and garlic are quite soft and translucent, throw in the pork belly and cook for a couple of minutes. Now throw in the chouriço slices. You'll see the oil and other ingredients take on a red colour from the spices in the chouriço. That's all the delicious flavour we want in our feijoada.</li>
            <li>After cooking the chouriço and pork belly for a few minutes, we can now get our black beans ready. Now, you may have a packet, or can, of black beans that are in water already, this is ideal, you can just pour the whole contents of the packet into the pan. However if you bought dry black beans, sadly you're going to have to soak those for about 4-12 hours before you can cook with them.</li>
            <li>Now that you've added your black beans, top up the pan with enough water so that everything is well covered. You can also now add your spices, I recommend being quite liberal with the smoked paprika powder, but this section is up to you. The chouriço itself is already quite seasoned, however you should still add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>And now we wait! No literally, the last step is to wait. Give this at least a couple of hours to fully cook through and develop its flavour and until the consistency is more sauce-like. I recommend keeping an eye on the feijoada, you might need to add more water if it has cooked down too quickly so that it doesn't burn at the bottom of the pan. Give it a couple of stirs here and there, but other than that you're all sorted! Once it has reached the desired consistency, give it a taste, you might need to adjust the seasonings, and then let it sit for a few minutes and serve!</li>
        </ol>
